Known Issues:
    Sometimes an asteroid either doesn't get deleted properly, or it becomes invisible, the wave system breaks. 
    If you think you destroyed all the asteroids, hit o once or twice. 


How to Use:
    Compile and run. All keys that were required are used
        
    Power ups spawn (easyily for you to see they exist) from a destroyed asteroid.

    Power ups:
        Starburst:
            The pick up displays a star.
            on pickup the player ship becomes yellow indicating you can do a starbust.
            A starbust is 10 bullets shot out in all directions. 
        Shield:
            The pickup displays a white ship with a blue circle around it
            on pickup the player grants a shield for 5 seconds. 
            During those 5 seconds the player can destroy asteroids on collision. 
            Player automatically gets this on spawn as well so thay they can spawn safely.
        Lives:
            The pickup displays a square with a cross
            on pickup the player gets an extra life (max 3)
            At start you can only spawn three times (shown by the ui component bottom left)




    xbox controller: 
    Y does a starburst when player is glowing yellow
    A to shoot
    Left joystick to move and change directions
    Start to respawn player

    Xbox controller vibrates when you shoot and when you die. If you died, it stops vibrating when you respawn (hit start) which was intentional. 
        
        
        
    Keyboard buttons
        O(on release) deletes
        I(on release) adds
        T(on push) Slows times
        T(on release) Time returns to normal
        P(on Push) Pauses/Unpauses. 
        Esc(on push) to exit.

	E/Up arrow thrust the player
	S/Left arrow rotate player counter clockwise
	D/Right arrow rotate player clockwise

	F1 to enter debug mode, f1 again to exit

    B to do a starburst. 

	Space to shoot

	N to respawn player


Deep Learning:
    
For Asteroid Gold, one of the obstacles I faced is that I just could not understand how the xbox controller api worked. 
Which is understandable since it is new to me, and a problem others might have had. However, I was too worried about 
looking like an idiot that I didn’t ask for help, leading to me staring at a screen for hours accomplishing nothing. 
Lately I have caught myself thinking “If I ask for help, will others (Students and Professors) think that I am dumb and 
shouldn’t be here.” After hearing Squirrels talk about being humble, I managed to ask my roommate and other programmers 
questions when I had problems. Which lead to me actually learning how the xbox controller worked AND later lead to me figuring 
out how the vibration feature works (yes, it is simple but I’m proud of it). Throughout asteroids itself, I’ve had the problem 
of asking for help, and over time I’ve slowly gotten better. For assignment one, I went to office hours, assignment two I asked 
for help during lab hours, and for this assignment I asked my fellow classmates for help. Learning to ask for help when it is 
needed is a valuable skill that I need and am working on so that:

I can become the best programmer that I can be.

My plan to improve: 
    1. Go to office hours at least once a week with questions based off of issues I ran into. 
    2. Go to at least one of the TA sessions to work on homework at the beginning of the assignment, but towards the end try and go to both. 
    3. Ask questions in our programmer discord to see other programmer’s way of tackling the problem. 
    4. If all else fails, just ask if someone can help you in person over a topic. 

If I don’t ask for help with the unknown, I will never grow.
