    FORMAT

Notes:
    - Path is relative so I already know itll be in Data/Audio so you just add after that 
    - Group is optional
    - Weight is a whole number out of 100 and the group should add up to 100. 
    - We create that many references to the sound when we get the list of sounds with that tag. 

    <Audio name = "default" group = "groupName" weight = "wholeNumberOutOf100" path="error.wav" />
